The data is related to bank marketing campaigns of banking institution based on phone call.
In this work, Python is used as a coding language and Machine learning concept is used as statistical learning for data analysis.
The main reason of using machine learning is to build a predictive model to produce the better prediction. 
The outcome of the result is analyzed with supervised Random forest algorithm for classification purpose.
The main objective of building the model is to describe whether the customer has opted for term deposit.
The bank should target the potential customer with considerable amount of time responding to the phone calls.
The work implemented resulted in measuring accuracy towards term deposit prediction.
